# remotely
A simple tool that manages your remote hosts (ssh, etc.), built in Python

**WORK IN PROGRESS**
While the program is currently in a mostly functional state, it is nowhere near ready for production use.
In its current state, it's actually pointless, as there is more typing involved than just invoking standard ssh commands.

Once it is packaged and ready for use, a beta version will be released.
